            <h2>19. Dispute Resolution</h2>
            <div class="important-notice">

            <h3>19.1 Informal Resolution</h3>
            <p>We prefer to resolve disputes informally. Before initiating arbitration, you agree to contact us at hi@nithichote.com to attempt resolution. We'll work in good faith to resolve any issues within 30 days.</p>
            
            <h3>19.2 Binding Arbitration</h3>

            <ul>
              <li><strong>Location:</strong> Arbitration may be conducted in your county of residence or Delaware, at your choice</li>
              <li><strong>Costs:</strong> For claims under $10,000, we'll pay all arbitration fees. For larger claims, fees will be allocated per AAA rules</li>

            </ul>
            
            <h3>19.3 Small Claims Court</h3>
            <p>Either party may bring claims in small claims court if they qualify, as an alternative to arbitration. This preserves access to a quick, inexpensive forum for smaller disputes.</p>
            
            <h3>19.4 Class Action Waiver</h3>
            <p>Both parties agree to bring claims only in an individual capacity, not as part of any class or representative action. If this waiver is found unenforceable, the entire arbitration provision shall be void.</p>
            
            <h3>19.5 Opt-Out Right</h3>
            <p>You may opt out of arbitration by sending written notice to hi@nithichote.com within 30 days of first accepting these Terms. If you opt out, disputes will be resolved in court under Delaware law.</p>

The performance of these Terms shall be excused to the extent of such prevention, restriction, or interference, and the affected party shall resume performance whenever such causes are removed.</p>
